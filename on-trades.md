### Domain settings on Github pages

- It seems to be preferable to use the *www* subdomain instead of the apex domain.
- On your domain provider advanced DNS tab, set:

		A record from @ to 185.199.108.153
		A record from @ to 185.199.109.153
		A record from @ to 185.199.110.153
		A record from @ to 185.199.111.153
		CNAME from www to yourdomain.extension
