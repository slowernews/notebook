## Clojurescript tooling

I've tried most avaliable solutions:

- vscode + calva: I couldn't understand the fuss around it. I didn't even manage to connect a repl..
- atom + chlorine: simple solution. a text editor and a repl. I used lumo. Not without quirks of course.
- emacs + cider: emacs is an old beast that after my fifth or sixth trial along the years I really believe that worths to tame. It certainly would become loyal for life. For now, I did't get even as far as installling cider..
- intellij + cursive: simple solution but it feels heavy for a drifter.
- sublime + sublimerepl: basic support.

# Elm

```elm
-- ELM

typicalAssigment : Num
typicalAssigment = 24				-- assigment is a like a function without arguments

typicalFunction : Num -> Num -> Num
typicalFunction x y = 2 * x + 2 * y		-- typical function with signature

functionPatternMatching : Num -> String
functionPatternMatching 1 = "one"
functionPatternMatching 2 = "two"
functionPatternMatching 3 = "three"
functionPatternMatching x = "out of range"
```
