# Notes on amateur cooking

### Signature dishes

You should have a few signature dishes. Having a full grasp of cuisine is less relevant than having some optimized recipes in the top of your mind. Your friends want to eat well and want to do it now.

## Noob level

### Pasta

- Pasta is one of easiest plates you can cook. Most mistakes will not make a big change on results. Most likely it will be eatable or even tasty.

## Advanced level

### Baking

- Mistakes are less forgiving in baking.

#### Home oven pizza recipe

- 250ml of flour (a weighing scale is not an essential tool for amateurs). Prefer type 65 flour without self raising, you'll use live ferment. 
- 100ml of water. Prefer tepid water (~35C) to contribute to a good environment for live ferment.
- full coffee spoon of salt.  
- 5 grams of live ferment.

Dough: dissolve the ferment and salt in the water. Only then pour the flour preferably using a sieve (you don't want to make cement). Mix. Reserve it in a hot (~30C) place and wait 4 hours or more.

Baking: wait until home oven gets maximum temperature. Bake in the oven's bottom until half cooked. Take it out and put toppings. Finish baking it in the oven's middle.

Results: better than frozen pizza. Guaranteed.
